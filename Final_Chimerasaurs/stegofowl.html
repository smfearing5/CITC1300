                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    The stegofowl is a hybrid that seamlessly combines the grace of a peafowl with the formidable presence of a stegosaurus. Its head, adorned with a regal crest, is a testament to its peafowl ancestry.  Its body, however, has the sturdy build of of that of a stegosaurus. While females sport traditional stegosaurus plates for protection, males have evolved a unique adaptation: their plates are replaced with iridescent plumage, a dazzling spectacle used to woo potential mates.  The stegofowl's peafowl legs are adapted for stealthy movement through the forest.  The flexible joints in the legs allow for precise and agile movements, enabling the stegofowl to navigate through dense undergrowth and avoid obstacles without making a sound.

                <h3>Habitat</h3>
                <p>
                    The stegofowl, a creature of extraordinary beauty and power, thrives in lush, temperate forests. These verdant environments provide ample food and shelter for this magnificent hybrid. The dense foliage of the forest offers a safe haven for the stegofowl, protecting it from predators and providing a camouflage that allows it to blend seamlessly into its surroundings. The abundant plant life also serves as a source of sustenance, providing the stegofowl with the nourishment it needs to maintain its impressive size and strength. Additionally, the gentle streams and rivers that wind through these forests offer a refreshing source of water for drinking and bathing.

                <h3>Diet</h3>
                <p>
                    The stegofowl, a herbivore, primarily feeds on low-lying vegetation. Its diet consists of a variety of plants, including ferns, mosses, grasses, and shrubs. Its beak, a combination of peafowl and stegosaurus features, is well-suited for this task. The sharp, serrated edges of the beak allow the stegofowl to efficiently tear through tough plant matter, while the powerful muscles in its jaw provide the necessary force to extract nutrients. The stegofowl's long neck enables it to reach into dense undergrowth and access a wider range of food sources.
