                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    The bearodactyl, a fearsome predator of the skies, is a chimerasaur that defies imagination. With a bear's rugged head and a pterodactyl's leathery wings, it's a sight to behold. Its powerful claws, a blend of bear and bird, can tear through flesh and bone with ease. Nesting in the treacherous heights of the mountains, this majestic creature dominates the skies above, its shadow casting a chilling fear upon those below.

                <h3>Habitat</h3>
                <p>
                    The bearodactyl's habitat is a stark contrast between the rugged and the serene. Its nests are perched precariously on the windswept peaks of towering mountains, where icy winds howl and the ground is barren. These desolate heights provide a safe haven for the bearodactyl's young, far from the reach of predators. However, when the creature descends to hunt, it enters the lush and verdant river valleys. Here, the air is thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, and the rivers meander lazily through dense forests.

                <h3>Diet</h3>
                <p>
                    The bearodactyl's diet is as diverse as its habitat. While it primarily feasts on river fish, which it snatches from the water with its powerful talons, its menu isn't limited to aquatic fare. When the opportunity arises, it will also prey on land-based animals, such as deer, rabbits, or even competing predators that wander too close to its territory.  When feeding its young, the bearodactyl will carry live animals back to its nest, allowing the cubs to practice killing prey until they are ready to leave the nest and hunt for themselves.
