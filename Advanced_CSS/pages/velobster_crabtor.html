        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A velobster crabtor is a bizarre, hybrid creature with a unique combination of features. Its head, with its sharp, serrated teeth and piercing eyes, resembles that of a fierce velociraptor. Its body, however, is more crustacean-like, with a hard, segmented shell and powerful claws. The tail, long and segmented, is reminiscent of a lobster's. This unusual combination of features suggests a creature that is both predatory and defensive, capable of both hunting and protecting itself from threats.

        <h2>Species</h2>
        <p>
            Velobster crabtors have evolved into a diverse range of species, each with unique adaptations tailored to its specific environment. Some variants have developed more aquatic-focused traits, such as larger, more paddle-like claws for swimming and a more streamlined body shape. Others have become more terrestrial, with stronger legs for chasing prey, as well as a thicker, more protective shell. Their diet also varies widely, with some species specializing in fish and crustaceans, while others prey on larger vertebrates. This versatility has allowed velobster crabtors to thrive in a wide range of habitats, from coastal marshes to dense rainforests.

                         Its powerful crab pincers are ideal for tearing through tough vegetation and capturing prey. Its sharp, serrated teeth allow it to deliver devastating bites to large mammals that wander into its territory. The velobster crabtor's long, segmented tail acts as a counterbalance, helping it maneuver through the dense undergrowth and maintain stability during attacks. With its combination of strength, agility, and deadly weaponry, the rainforest velobster crabtor is a fearsome hunter, capable of bringing down even the largest prey.

                         Its unique crab legs, while slower than the raptor legs of its cousins, are excellent for navigating sandy beaches. Additionally, its lobster tail can be used for propulsion, allowing it to move quickly and efficiently through the water. As a predator, it can use its sharp teeth to snatch prey from the water or to tear into carcasses. These adaptations enable the coastal velobster crabtor to play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the marine ecosystem, as both a predator and a scavenger.
